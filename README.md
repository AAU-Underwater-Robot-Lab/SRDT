# SRDT
Synthethic and real data set employed to study the impact of turbidity as an isolated parameter under the values of 0, 0.7, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 FTU


The file should contain:
links to our synthethic data as well the blender file. 
Different turbidities table (mean. median and standar deviation)
real data and annotated real data
table with more details of the models employed
table with all parameters calculated mPrediction, mAccuracy, mDice, mIoU
Table with the objects (pool aswell) employed as well as their dimension and materials
Kaolin link and sensors
a more detailed explanation of how the apparent absorbance is developed to provide the color absorbance and the scattering coefficients
